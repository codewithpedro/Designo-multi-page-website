- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Practicing basic programming

With the knowledge of React, CSS, HTML, and Typescript, I was able to complete the projects with little to no obstacles. By using React, I was able to reuse components for the navigation, footer, contacts, and location. This will save me time from copying and pasting the same code. Then I placed each page with its unique component and added the basic html for each page layout. When designing the page with CSS, I had used my own style name convention. I could use a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, however, for a personal project itâ€™ll be easier specifying each element name. The best practices for a company would be to use a framework because everyone has different name conventions creating a tornado code, where everyone will confuse elements. With a framework everyone understands how styling classes will be organized. After completing the CSS, the only thing unique about the website is having an interactive map for the locations. Overall the project was simple and easy to code.
